                The ultimate goal of this club is to bring people together who
                are passionate about coding regardless of their career stage or
                current level of knowledge. Our virtual meetups are meant to
                introduce people to one another, talk about different
                technologies, side projects, share ideas, and much more. We also
                plan on having guest speakers from local and foreign tech
                companies share their experience and provide practical advice
                about coding and all things tech.
